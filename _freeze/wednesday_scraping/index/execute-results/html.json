A lot of it is publicly available and thus suitable for use in research. Extracting that information and putting it in an organized format for analysis can however, be extremely tedious.*\n\n*Web scraping tools allow to automate parts of that process and Python is a popular language for the task.*\n\n*In this workshop, I will guide you through a simple example using the package [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).*\n\n## HTML and CSS\n\n[HyperText Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (HTML) is the standard markup language for websites: it encodes the information related to the formatting and structure of webpages. Additionally, some of the customization can be stored in [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) (CSS) files.\n\nHTML uses tags of the form:\n\n```{.html}\n<some_tag>Your content</some_tag>\n```\n\nSome tags have attributes:\n\n```{.html}\n<some_tag attribute_name=\"attribute value\">Your content</some_tag>\n```\n\n:::{.example}\n\nExamples:\n\n:::\n\nSite structure:\n\n- `<h2>This is a heading of level 2</h2>`\n- `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`\n\nFormatting:\n\n- `<b>This is bold</b>`\n- `<a href=\"https://some.url\">This is the text for a link</a>`\n\n## Web scrapping\n\nWeb scraping is a general term for a set of tools which allow for the extraction of data from the web automatically.\n\nWhile most of the data on the internet is publicly available, it is illegal to scrape some sites and you should always look into the policy of a site before attempting to scrape it. Some sites will also block you if you submit too many requests in a short amount of time, so remember to scrape responsibly.\n\n## Goal of this workshop\n\nWe will use [a website](https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/index.html) from the [University of Tennessee](https://www.utk.edu/) containing a database of PhD theses from that university.\n\nOur goal is to scrape data from this site to produce a dataframe with the date, major, and principal investigator (PI) for each dissertation.\n\n:::{.note}\n\nWe will only do this for the first page which contains the links to the 100 most recent theses. If you really wanted to gather all the data, you would have to do this for all pages.\n\n:::\n\n## Let's look at the sites\n\nFirst of all, let's have a close look at the websites we want to scrape to think carefully about what we want to do. Before starting to write code, it is always a good idea to think about what you are trying to achieve with your code.\n\nTo create a dataframe with the data for all the dissertations on that first page, we need to do two things:\n\n- Step 1: from the [dissertations database first page](https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/index.html), we want to scrape the list of URLs for the dissertation pages.\n\n- Step 2: once we have the URLs, we want to scrape those pages too to get the date, major, and principal investigator (PI) for each dissertation.\n\n## Load packages\n\nLet's load the packages that will make scraping websites with Python easier:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport requests                 # To download the html data from a site\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup   # To parse the html data\nimport pandas as pd             # To store our data in a DataFrame\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Read in HTML data from the main site\n\nAs mentioned above, our site is the [database of PhD dissertations from the University of Tennessee](https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/index.html).\n\nLet's create a string with the URL:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl = \"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/index.html\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nFirst, we send a request to that URL:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nr = requests.get(url)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Explore the raw data\n\nLet's print the first 1000 characters of the raw data:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(r.text[:1000])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head><!-- inj yui3-seed: --><script type='text/javascript' src='//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/yui/3.6.0/yui/yui-min.js'></script><script type='text/javascript' src='//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js'></script><!-- Adobe Analytics --><script type='text/javascript' src='https://assets.adobedtm.com/4a848ae9611a/d0e96722185b/launch-d525bb0064d8.min.js'></script><!-- Cookies --><link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cookieconsent2/3.0.3/cookieconsent.min.css' /><script type='text/javascript' src='//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cookieconsent2/3.0.3/cookieconsent.min.js'></script><script type='text/javascript' src=/assets/nr_browser_production.js></script>\n\n<!-- def.1 -->\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\">\n<title>\nDoctoral Dissertations | Graduate School | University of Tennessee, Knoxville\n</title>\n\n\n<!-- FILE meta-tags.inc --><!-- FILE: /srv/sequoi\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Parse the data\n\nThe package [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows to transform (parse) the data in a way that will make extracting information easier.\n\nLet's create an object called `soup` with the parsed data:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, \"html.parser\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n`soup` is an object of a type specific to the Beautiful Soup package:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntype(soup)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=94}\n```\nbs4.BeautifulSoup\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Test run\n\nIt is a good idea to test things out on a single element before doing a massive batch scraping of a site, so let's test our method for the first dissertation.\n\n### Extract a test URL\n\nTo start, we need to extract the first URL.\n\n#### Identify the relevant HTML markers\n\nThe html code for this webpage contains the data we are interested in, but it is mixed in with a lot of HTML formatting information and data we aren't interested in. We need to extract it and turn it into a workable format.\n\nThe first step is to find the CSS elements that contain the data we want. For this, you can use a web inspector or—even easier—the [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/), a JavaScript bookmarklet built by [Andrew Cantino](https://andrewcantino.com/).\n\nTo use this tool, a simple option is to go to the [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) website and drag the link of the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar.\n\nNow, go to the [dissertations database first page](https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/index.html) and click on the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar. You will see a floating box at the bottom of your screen and an orange rectangle appears around each element of the page over which you hover your mouse.\n\nIf you hover above the first paragraph that contains one of the links to a dissertation page, you can see `div p` in the bottom left corner. And if you click on it, you learn that the CSS class for that element is `article-listing` (you can see `.article-listing` in the SelectorGadget box at the bottom of the page). This is the information we need to get started.\n\n#### Use the HTML markers\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsoup.select('a[href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/7600\"]')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=95}\n```\n[<a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/7600\">The Novel Chlorination of Zirconium Metal and Its Application to a Recycling Protocol for Zircaloy Cladding from Spent Nuclear Fuel Rods</a>]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's create an object `url_test` using this information. We extract from our object `soup` the first element for which `p` (a paragraph) is of the class `article-listing`:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl_test = soup.find('p', class_='article-listing')\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's see what we got:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(url_test.prettify())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<p class=\"article-listing\">\n <a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/7600\">\n  The Novel Chlorination of Zirconium Metal and Its Application to a Recycling Protocol for Zircaloy Cladding from Spent Nuclear Fuel Rods\n </a>\n , Breanna K. Vestal\n</p>\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.note}\n\nThe `prettify` method makes things a little more readable.\n\n:::\n\nThis is quite ugly ... the URL is in there, so we successfully extracted the correct paragraph, but we need to do more cleaning.\n\nIf we go back to the SelectorGadget and hover above a link in that first paragraph, we can see in the bottom left corner `p a`. This is because links are identified in HTML with the tag `a`.\n\nLet's extract `a` (the link) out of our paragraph:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl_test = soup.find('p', class_='article-listing').find('a')\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe now get:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(url_test.prettify())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/7600\">\n The Novel Chlorination of Zirconium Metal and Its Application to a Recycling Protocol for Zircaloy Cladding from Spent Nuclear Fuel Rods\n</a>\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is better. We now only have the link. But links in HTML consist of the text displayed on screen and the URL linked to it. It is the URL we want. It is under the attribute `href` as you can see when you print `url_test`. To extract an attribute value, we use the method `get`:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl_test = soup.find('p', class_='article-listing').find('a').get('href')\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we print this last version of `url_test`, we can see that we now have exactly what we wanted (the URL of the first dissertation information page) and nothing else:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(url_test)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nhttps://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/7600\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Read in HTML data for our test URL\n\nNow that we have the URL for the first dissertation information page, we want to extract the date, major, and principal investigator (PI) for that dissertation.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntype(url_test)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=102}\n```\nstr\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`url_test` is a string representing an URL. We know how to deal with this!\n\nThe first thing to do—as we did earlier with the database site—is to send a request to that page. Let's assign it to a new object that we will call `r_test`:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nr_test = requests.get(url_test)\nsoup_test = BeautifulSoup(r_test.content, \"html.parser\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Get data for our test URL\n\nIt is time to extract the publication date, major, and PI for our test URL.\n\nLet's start with the date. Thanks to the [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/), following [the method we saw earlier](#identify-the-relevant-html-markers), we can see that we now need the paragraph of class `#publication_date`.\n\nWhile earlier we wanted the value of a tag attribute (i.e. part of the metadata), here we want the actual text (i.e. part of the actual content). To extract text from a snippet of HTML, we pass it to `html_text2()`.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndate_test = soup_test.find('div', attrs={'id' : 'alpha'})\nprint(date_test)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<div id=\"alpha\">\n<!-- FILE: /srv/sequoia/main/data/assets/site/ir_etd/article/article_info.inc (cont) --><div class=\"element\" id=\"title\">\n<h4>Title</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9084&amp;context=utk_graddiss\">The Novel Chlorination of Zirconium Metal and Its Application to a Recycling Protocol for Zircaloy Cladding from Spent Nuclear Fuel Rods</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"element\" id=\"authors\">\n<h4>Author</h4>\n<p class=\"author\"><a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/do/search/?q=author_lname%3A%22Vestal%22%20author_fname%3A%22Breanna%22&amp;start=0&amp;context=885231\"><strong>Breanna K.

This protocol is based on the chemistry developed from two new scientific findings.</p>\n<p>First, two new oxidative chlorination reactions have been discovered for zirconium metal. In both solvents, zirconium can be quantitatively chlorinated at temperatures less than 150°C, with the operative equations seen below. In sulfur monochloride, the reaction is completed in 2 – 4 hours via surface etching, exhibiting 0<sup>th</sup> order kinetic behavior. The elemental sulfur byproduct can be quantitatively rechlorinated to sulfur monochloride immediately following the Zircaloy chlorination so the only consumable material from the reaction is chlorine. In thionyl chloride, the reaction is completed in 7 – 40 hours with a variable induction period. The time-to-completion may be lowered by increasing the temperature of the reacting metal or by utilizing a reagent to clean the surface. Based on previous studies, sulfur monochloride has been shown to clean the surface of the metal during reaction. Therefore, a mixture of sulfur monochloride and thionyl chloride may also be utilized to chlorinate zirconium, with a time-to-completion between 2 – 4 hours. The active chlorinating agent remains thionyl chloride.</p>\n<p>Second, a new method to purify zirconium chloride from the chlorination reactions was investigated. It has been reported that zirconium chloride forms an adduct with thionyl chloride. However, to our knowledge, the solubility of the zirconium chloride in thionyl chloride has not been reported. The solubility is both high and temperature dependent in comparison to other metal chlorides investigated. This allowed for the development of crystallization procedures to obtain high yields of purified zirconium chloride. In the context of the recycling protocol for the Zircaloy, the product may either be decontaminated to reclassify it as low-level waste or reused by the industry.</p>\n<p>This protocol has been performed in the presence of depleted uranium oxide pellets. Fuel pellets do not affect zirconium chlorination, and the chlorination does not alter the fuel pellets.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"element\" id=\"recommended_citation\">\n<h4>Recommended Citation</h4>\n<!-- FILE: /srv/sequoia/main/data/journals/trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/assets/ir_citation.inc --><p>Vestal, Breanna K., \"The Novel Chlorination of Zirconium Metal and Its Application to a Recycling Protocol for Zircaloy Cladding from Spent Nuclear Fuel Rods. \" PhD diss., University of Tennessee, 2023.<br/>https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/7600</p><!-- FILE: /srv/sequoia/main/data/assets/site/ir_etd/article/article_info.inc (cont) --></div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Full run\n\n#### Extract all URLs\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndata = soup.find_all('p', class_='article-listing')\nprint(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[<p class=\"article-listing\"><a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/7600\">The Novel Chlorination of Zirconium Metal and Its Application to a Recycling Protocol for Zircaloy Cladding from Spent Nuclear Fuel Rods</a>, Breanna K.
