She completed her undergraduate degree at Memorial in applied math and physics and then pursued her masters in biomedical physics at Ryerson University. Her masters research involved exploring the design and behaviour analysis of microbubbles and nanobubbles, which are used as contrast agents in ultrasound. This required the development of an algorithm to sort through and differentiate RF data demonstrating bubble behaviour using MATLAB. Throughout her masters, Grace sought out professional development opportunities that focused on improving learning and teaching in higher education. As ACENET’s Training Coordinator she is responsible for the organization and landscape of ACENET’s Training. Most recently, this has included offering support to increase the training resources available to the Humanities and Social Sciences community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMeghan Landry recently joined ACENET as a Humanities & Social Sciences Research Specialist from St. Francis Xavier University, where she was a Scholarly Communications Librarian. In that role, she was very involved with the university’s strategic efforts in research data management and open access. She was responsible for implementing St. FX’s first institutional repository, StFX Scholar. Previously, she worked as a Digital Initiatives Librarian and managed the University of Prince Edward Island Library’s Virtual Research Environments (VREs) and Islandora repositories, which showcase digital collections and research related to PEI history. Meghan possesses an MLIS from McGill University and a BA in English Literature from UPEI. She is working towards a Technical Writing certification. Meghan is based at St. FX University but serves all of Atlantic Canada and is active in both national and regional humanities and social sciences initiatives."
